The most abundant tick-borne diseases in Germany are Tick-Borne Encephalitis (TBE) and Lyme Borreliosis (LB), with Ixodes ricinus as the main vector. Methods: In this study, we display and compare the spatial and temporal patterns of reported cases of human TBE and LB in relation to some associated factors. The comparison may help with the interpretation of observed spatial and temporal patterns. Results: The spatial patterns of reported TBE cases show a clear and consistent pattern over the years, with many cases in the south and only few and isolated cases in the north of Germany. The identi\\ufb01cation of spatial patterns of LB disease cases is more dif\\ufb01cult due to the different reporting practices in the individual federal states. Temporal patterns strongly \\ufb02uctuate between years, and are relatively synchronized between both diseases, suggesting common driving factors. Based on our results we found no evidence that weather conditions affect the prevalence of both diseases. Both diseases show a gender bias with LB bing more commonly diagnosed in females, contrary to TBE being more commonly diagnosed in males. Conclusion: For a further investigation of of the underlying driving factors and their interrelations, longer time series as well as standardised reporting and surveillance system would be required.\\nCorresponding author Sarah Cunze, cunze@bio.uni-frankfurt.de\\nAcademic editor Erika Braga\\nSubjects Parasitology, Epidemiology, Infectious Diseases, Public Health Keywords Ixodes ricinus, Tick-borne diseases, Vector-host-interaction, Weather conditions, Land cover, Robert Koch Institute, Castor bean tick, Climate change\\nAdditional Information and Declarations can be found on page 16\\nINTRODUCTION\\nDOI 10.7717/peerj.12422\\nCopyright 2021 Cunze et al.\\nDistributed under Creative Commons CC-BY 4.0\\nTick-borne diseases in Europe In recent years, tick populations in Europe have been observed to expand their range further north to higher latitudes and altitudes (Gilbert, 2010a; S\\u00fcss, 2011). This range shift has been accompanied by an increase in the number of human tick-borne disease (TBD)\\nHow to cite this article Cunze S, Glock G, Klimpel S. 2021.

However, this increase could also be due, at least in part, to better diagnostics and higher awareness.\\nTicks are competent vectors for a number of pathogens, including viruses, bacteria or parasites, which can cause serious infections in humans and animals. Ixodes ricinus is the most abundant and widespread tick species in Europe (Gray et al., 2009) and the primary vector for Lyme borreliosis (LB) and tick-borne encephalitis (TBE), the most common diseases associated to ticks in Europe (Semenza & Suk, 2018).\\nLyme borreliosis, also known as Lyme disease, is caused by bacteria of the Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato complex, which comprises about 20 members; six of them are con\\ufb01rmed to be human pathogens (Lin et al., 2020). With approximately 65,000 cases per year, LB is the most frequent tick-borne disease in the European Union (Robert Koch- Institut, 2020).\\nTBE is a viral infection caused by one of three tick-borne encephalitis virus subtypes belonging to the Flaviviridae family; over the last 30 years, a large increase of nearly 400% in the number of recorded cases has been observed worldwide (Fong, 2020). Although this increase can be partly explained by enhanced surveillance and diagnostic TBE should be considered a growing public health challenge in Europe and other parts of the world (Medlock et al., 2013).\\nBoth pathogens are transmitted to humans through the bite of infected ticks.\\nEcology and life cycle of Ixodes ricinus Ixodes ricinus, the primary vector of TBE and LB in Europe, is a three-host tick: After hatching from the egg, there are three distinct stages (larva, nymph, adult) in the life cycle. Each passage, from larva to nymph as well as from nymph to adult stage, requires a blood meal before the subsequent moult. Ticks only feed once per life stage (larva, nymph and adult female). After the blood-sucking process, that takes about 2\\u20134 days for larvae and 3\\u20135 days for nymphs, the tick detaches and develops in the vegetation (moulting) (Gray, 1998). After mating and another blood meal (duration of about 6\\u201310 days) the female adults tick lays a batch of between 1,000 and 5,000 eggs and then dies (S\\u00fcss, 2003). The average timespan of each stage is approximately 8\\u201312 months but can be extended to 2 up to 6 years (Gray, 1998; Stanek et al., 2012). Under favourable environmental conditions ticks are able to survive for several months without feeding (Heyman et al., 2010).\\nLike most ectothermic terrestrial organisms, the development and activity of ticks depend on weather and climatic conditions. Ixodes ricinus ticks may enter a prolonged behavioral or developmental diapause when hosts are not available or environmental conditions are unsuitable for the ticks (Gray, 1998; Heyman et al., 2010). The activity phase begins when temperatures rise to a certain level in spring (to 5 to 7 \\u0001C), i.e., March/April according (S\\u00fcss, 2003) and ends when it gets too cold in late autumn or winter. Other factors, such as summer drought, can regionally lead to reduced tick activity. Mild winters or in thermally favoured regions can lead to activity during the winter (Dautel et al., 2008).\\nCunze et al. (2021), PeerJ, DOI 10.7717/peerj.12422 2/20\\n\\nThe host spectrum of I. ricinus comprises more than 300 vertebrate species (wild and domestic mammals, reptiles and birds). Preferred host species differ between the life stages (Stanek et al., 2012): The larvae feed on animals of all sizes (S\\u00fcss, 2011), particularly small mammals, birds and reptiles, nymphs feed on medium-sized mammals such as foxes but also on birds and humans (S\\u00fcss, 2011). The adult stage feeds more exclusively on larger mammals such as deer, sheep, dogs and humans (Medlock et al., 2013).\\nIxodes ricinus shows an exophilic (non-nidicolous) behaviour in all stages, i.e., individuals do not live in or near the shelters used by their vertebrate hosts. Preferred habitats are all woodlands, especially deciduous forests and the transition zones between forests and grasslands (Estrada-Pe\\u00f1a, Mihalca & Petney, 2018). Ixodes ricinus occurs throughout a large part of continental Europe and the species is assumed to be nearly omnipresent in Germany (Estrada-Pe\\u00f1a, Mihalca & Petney, 2018; ECDC, 2019).\\nTransmission cycle Borrelia burgdorferi bacteria and the TBE viruses circulate between I. ricinus individuals and their vertebrate hosts. Ticks become infected when they feed on birds or mammals that carry the pathogens in their blood and may transmit the pathogens with the following blood meal to the next host (Stanek et al., 2012). Adult ticks usually feed on larger animals such as deer, which are not a reservoir for B. burgdorferi bacteria, but help to maintain the ticks\\u2019 reproductive stage (ECDC, 2020). The main reservoir hosts of TBE virus are mainly small rodents, e.g., voles and mice, but also insectivores and carnivores (CDC, 2020; ECDC, 2020). Ticks, speci\\ufb01cally hard ticks of the family Ixodidae, act as both the vector and reservoir for TBE viruses (CDC, 2020).\\nTransmission of B. burgdorferi to humans occurs through a bite from an infected tick, in most cases by a tick in the nymph stage (Gray, 1998). Being more numerous than adult ticks, nymphal ticks are responsible for approximately 80% of tick bites in many areas (Heyman et al., 2010) and, thus, we may expect them to cause most of LB cases. Larval tick bites do not pose a signi\\ufb01cant risk because larvae rarely carry infection (Gray et al., 1998). In \\ufb01eld collections less than 1% of host seeking larvae have been found to be infected with B. burgdorferi (Hofhuis et al., 2017) which may be attributed to transovarial transmission (Humair & Gern, 2000).\\nInfected ticks are unlikely to transmit the B. burgdorferi s.l. in the early hours of a feed, but the risk rises steadily the longer the blood meal takes; so early removal of attached ticks within the \\ufb01rst hours is very useful in reducing transmission risk (ECDC, 2014).\\nIn contrast, the TBE virus can even be transmitted from the saliva of an infected tick within the \\ufb01rst minutes of the bite (Lindquist & Vapalahti, 2008).\\nFactors affecting the number of human tick-borne disease cases The risk of human infection by TBDs depends on many environmental factors and their interactions, affecting both the ecology of the pathogens and that of the vectors and reservoir hosts (S\\u00fcss, 2003). The number of TBD cases in humans thus primarily depends on the abundance of tick species, the frequency of contact between humans and ticks and the prevalence of the pathogens. The higher the number of ticks, the higher the risk for\\nCunze et al. (2021), PeerJ, DOI 10.7717/peerj.12422 3/20\\n\\nFigure 1 Factors that potentially affect the number of recorded human tick-borne disease cases.\\n\\ue90d\\nFull-size\\nDOI: 10.7717/peerj.12422/\\ufb01g-1\\nhumans to be bitten; the higher the prevalence of pathogens, the higher the risk of becoming infected through a tick bite (Randolph, 2008; Pf\\u00e4f\\ufb02e et al., 2013; Wikel, 2018; Escobar, 2020).\\nThe abundance of ticks depends on climatic and weather conditions (e.g., mild winters favour a high abundance in the following season), land cover (e.g., higher abundances in forested areas) and the abundance of hosts (e.g., small rodents, birds, red deer and wild boars) (Randolph, 2008; Jaenson & Lindgren, 2011; Jaenson et al., 2012; Medlock et al., 2013). Temperature can also have a direct impact on the transmission risk of pathogens as it in\\ufb02uences reproduction of pathogens in ectothermal vector species. Thus, it is assumed that higher temperatures have a direct effect on the risk of infection with tick-borne diseases (Samuel, Adelman & Myles, 2016).\\nThere are several interactions between the components that in\\ufb02uence the risk for humans of becoming infected with tick-borne pathogens (Fig. 1). The prevalence of TBD agents in ticks also depends on the availability of hosts and the prevalence of TBD agents in hosts. In particular, it is assumed that the abundance of small rodents depends on the availability of food (depending on the fructi\\ufb01cation of forest trees) and weather conditions (Klempa, 2009; Reil et al., 2015). In spatial terms, land cover may play an important role (e.g., forest cover) (Randolph, 2010; Pf\\u00e4f\\ufb02e et al., 2013). Human behaviour depends on the weather situation and on land cover (Randolph, 2010): People spend more time outside in good weather than in bad weather and forested regions may be more crowded than other land cover types. For TBE, vaccination coverage is also an important factor (Randolph, 2008).\\nAims and scopes In this study, we display the spatial and temporal (annual and seasonal) patterns of LB and TBE based on the data provided by the Robert-Koch-Institute (RKI) between 2001 and\\nCunze et al. (2021), PeerJ, DOI 10.7717/peerj.12422 4/20\\n\\n2019. We discuss and compare these patterns considering possible underlying drivers: climatic and weather conditions and other factors (see Fig. 1).\\nMATERIALS AND METHODS We tried to link additional data with the spatial and temporal patterns of the reported cases of the two tick-borne diseases in Germany. All maps are based on data downloaded from various databases, and data covered the following variables:\\na) Data on reported cases of LB and TBE (from hereon after \\u201creported cases\\u201d refers to\\nhuman cases only) was downloaded at a spatial level of German administrative districts (German: \\u201cLandkreise\\u201d) for the years 2001 to 2019 with a temporal resolution of one calendar week (Robert Koch-Institut: SurvStat@RKI 2.0, https://survstat.rki.de, query date: 03.02.2020) and mapped using the geometry of NUTS250 (Nomenclature des unit\\u00e9s territoriales statistiques) data provided by the German Federal Agency for Cartography und Geodesy (GeoBasis-DE/BKG (2020)) and using Esri ArcGIS software (Esri, Rednands, CA, USA).\\nb) Data on population numbers in each of the German administrative districts were taken\\nfrom the German Federal Agency for Cartography und Geodesy (GeoBasis-DE/BKG (2020)-status of the documentation 01.12.2017, accessed on 02.03.2020).\\nc) Occurrence records for Ixodes ricinus as the major vector of TBE and LB were taken\\nfrom the Global Biodiversity Information Facility (GBIF) data base (www.GBIF.org, DOI 10.15468/dl.yak5vd (GBIF), accessed on 23.06.2020). We also used information of the currently known distribution of I. ricinus by administrative districts based on data from the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC, 2019).\\nd) Taking the wild boar (Sus scrofa) as one example of an important host species, we used\\ndata on its spatial distribution at the level of administrative districts (Nuts3 units), more speci\\ufb01cally, the number of reported individuals (hunted and roadkill) per 100 ha of hunting area in the respective administrative district. The data was compiled by the German Hunting Association (Deutscher Jagdverband DJV) as part of the WILD monitoring (DJV, 2020). We chose the wild boar as a representative of a large host of ticks because of data available and because we assume that other medium and large forest-associated hosts (roe deer, red deer, red fox\\u2026) of ticks show similar ecological requirements and therefore similar distribution patterns (see also below-h).\\ne) Data on temperature and precipitations patterns in Germany was taken from the\\nGerman Meteorological Service (Deutscher Wetterdienst DWD). We considered the mean annual temperature and precipitation, both averaged over the empirical data from 1981 to 2010 per grid cell (1 km \\u00d7 1 km) for spatial patterns, and the mean monthly mean air temperature and precipitation from 2001 to 2019 for temporal patterns.\\nf) The percentage of forest area in each German administrative district was derived from\\nthe Corine landcover data (CLC, 2012) provided by the Copernicus Land Monitoring Service, coordinated by the European Environment Agency (EEA) and includes deciduous forest, coniferous forest and mixed forest (3.1.1, 3.1.2, 3.1.3).\\nCunze et al. (2021), PeerJ, DOI 10.7717/peerj.12422 5/20\\n\\ng) Data on beech mast stem from reports on the state of the forests (in German:\\n\\u201cWaldzustandberichte\\u201d) of individual German federal states. Since the data are not available for all federal states over the entire period, the values of the federal states Baden-Wuerttemberg (WZB, 2018a), Bavaria (WZB, 2019a), Brandenburg (WZB, 2018b), Hesse (WZB, 2019b) and Saxony (WZB, 2019c) were averaged for each year between 2002 and 2019. Despite observed smaller regional differences in beech mast (Reil et al., 2015), it is generally assumed that mast years are largely driven by weather conditions that have occurred in previous years in combination with refractory periods to accumulate resources (Piovesan & Adams, 2001; Overgaard, Gemmel & Karlsson, 2007; Cunze et al., 2018). We therefore argue that the averages of the empirical data from the above mentioned \\ufb01ve federal states are a good measure for the average situation in Germany.\\nh) Occurrence data for selected small rodents (main hosts for ticks in larval and\\nnymph stages), medium and large mammals (main hosts for adult ticks and important dispersal vectors for ticks) as well as bird species (also serving as hosts and dispersal vectors for ticks) were taken from GBIF (www.GBIF.org, GBIF, 2021).\\nA map including names of federal states and single administrative districts is given in the appendix (Fig. S1). All maps were generated using Esri ArcMap, version 10.8.1.\\nRESULTS Spatial patterns of reported TBE and LB disease cases in Germany 2001-2019\\nThe spatial distribution of the incidence (reported cases per 100,000 inhabitants) of TBE in Germany (Fig. 2) shows a very similar pattern for all years between 2001 and 2019, with a larger number of cases in the south of Germany and far fewer cases in the north. In the north, no cases have been reported in the majority of German administrative district, whereas up to 13 cases per 100,000 inhabitants have been reported from administrative districts in the south, with the highest number of cases located in the federal states Bavaria and Baden-Wuerttemberg, South Hesse, South-East Thuringia and Saxony. Generally, the number of recorded TBE cases seems to increase over time and individual districts seem to be particularly affected but without a temporal pattern.\\nThe spatial pattern of LB infections over time in Germany is depicted in Fig. 3. In many federal states, the obligation to report LB infections was \\ufb01rst introduced in the period between 2001 and 2019 (e.g., Saarland and Rhineland-Palatinate in 2011 and Bavaria in 2016) or is still not in place (e.g., Baden-W\\u00fcrttemberg, Hesse, North Rhine-Westphalia, Lower Saxony and Schleswig-Holstein) and explains the large amount of grey area with no available data on LB cases. Due to the different regulations on reporting obligations in the federal states of Germany, spatial patterns are dif\\ufb01cult to assess. Considering areas with existing reporting obligations, there are no clear patterns such as gradients or hotspots.\\nWith regard to factors assumed to in\\ufb02uence the spatial patterns of tick-borne disease occurrence, we have mapped spatial patterns in the occurrence of each component in the transmission cycle (humans, Ixodes ricinus as the main vector species and wild boar\\nCunze et al.

Since there is no nationwide reporting obligation for LB in Germany, we have only shown the mean data for the six federal states in which there has been a continuous reporting obligation since 2002 in Fig. 4B.\\nFor example, the district S\\u00e4chsische Schweiz Osterzgebirge in the south of Saxony (cf. Fig. S1), which has a high total number of reported LB cases in the period 2002 to 2019\\nCunze et al. (2021), PeerJ, DOI 10.7717/peerj.12422 9/20\\n\\n(4,116 cases, Fig. 4B), is characterized by a relatively high population density (Fig. 4C), average wild boar density (Fig. 4E) and rather low forest cover (Fig. 4H). Temperatures are also comparatively low with a lot of precipitation (Figs. 4F, 4G). On the other hand, the hotspot for LB in 2016 and 2018 for LB in eastern Bavaria (Fig. 3) in the administrative districts Regen and Freyung-Gravenau (cf. Fig. S1). These two districts are characterized by a low population density (Fig. 4C), a high proportion of forest (Fig. 4H) and a relatively low density of wild boar (Fig. 4E). Ticks were reported from these areas (Fig. 4D). The temperatures are comparatively low with high precipitation (Figs. 4F, 4G).\\nThe North-South gradient in the number of human TBE infections in Germany (Fig. 2) is not re\\ufb02ected by any of the factors displayed in Figs. 4C\\u20134H.\\nIn the temporal patterns, the numbers of reported cases of TBE (Fig. 5A) and LB (Fig. 5A) show seasonal variations with low numbers of cases in the winter months. It can be seen, for example, that 2012 with remarkably low numbers of recorded cases for both diseases (Figs. 5A\\u20135D) was preceded by four winters with very low temperatures in winter (Fig. 5E). The year 2018 with comparably high numbers of recorded cases for both diseases (Figs. 5A\\u20135D) was preceded by two cold winters (Fig. 5E) but also a strong beech mast year in 2017 (Fig. 5G). Overall, the temperature conditions cannot be clearly related to the temporal patterns in the reported TBD cases. For precipitation (Fig. 5F) it is also dif\\ufb01cult to link the temporal patterns.\\nIn the period under consideration, 2002 to 2019, no signi\\ufb01cant trend could be observed in the annually reported case numbers for TBE and a slightly positive, signi\\ufb01cant trend (p-value = 0.02402) in the reported LB numbers (all cases reported in the six eastern German federal states: Brandenburg, Berlin, Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, Saxony, Saxony-Anhalt and Thuringia).\\nHowever, there are strong \\ufb02uctuations between years. The annual \\ufb02uctuations of both diseases move in parallel. A clear correlation of disease cases of TBE and LB can be seen when looking at annual and monthly resolution (Fig. 6). Years with a high number of TBE cases also show high numbers in LB cases and vice versa. When looking at the monthly data, an even stronger correlation becomes apparent, which is partly due to the similar seasonal patterns.\\nThe gender distribution of both TBDs cases, shows consistent patterns across different age groups for LB (Fig. 7A): with higher incidences for females in the age categories 30-39, 40-49, 50-59, 60-60 and 70-79 years and for TBE (Fig. 7B): higher incidences for males in all age groups.\\nDISCUSSION Ticks are important disease-transmitting vectors. Vector-borne diseases are on the rise in Europe, which has been attributed to climate-change induced range shift of the tick vectors. Here we described the spatial and temporal patterns of human TBE and LB cases in Germany in relation to possible underlying drivers. There are many factors assumed to affect the spatial-temporal patterns of human tick-borne diseases and their interrelationships are complex.\\nCunze et al.

Full-size\\nDOI: 10.7717/peerj.12422/\\ufb01g-5\\nWe found the temporal patterns to \\ufb02uctuate strongly between years, and the patterns for both diseases are relatively synchronized. The strong connection between the numbers of cases of both diseases in the temporal patterns suggest that similar driving forces are involved. The presence of I. ricinus as the main vector of both diseases in Europe is the key determinant for the incidence of both diseases.\\nThe temporal and spatial patterns presented in this study are considered typical for both diseases and are in accordance with those shown in studies in other European countries\\nCunze et al.

The seasonal patterns with a peak in summer and a subsequent decline to nearly zero in the winter months in the reported TBE cases and only to a few LB cases are clearly attributed to the annual cycle of the ticks with a diapause in winter and questing behaviour during their activity phase. This is obvious, as the diseases cannot be\\nCunze et al.

Full-size\\ntransmitted without blood-sucking ticks (apart from a small number of TBE cases associated with the consumption of raw milk). In addition, small mammals that act as hosts are also almost inactive during the winter months.\\nThe seasonal patterns of reported cases of both diseases are very similar with a slightly earlier peak for TBE whose German name translates to \\u201cEarly Summer Meningoencephalitis\\u201d. Randolph (2010) reports that the seasonal patterns in the activity of questing nymphs show a similar pattern, but with peaks spared again towards earlier times of the year. This could generally be explained by the incubation time and delay in reporting (Robert Koch-Institut, 2007).\\nThe fact that the number of reported LB cases does not reduce to zero in winter despite the assumed inactivity of the transmitting ticks can be attributed on the one hand by a delayed diagnosis. On the other hand, increased tick activity during the winter months is reported (Dautel et al., 2008), which may be due to changed climatic conditions, especially milder winter temperatures in the northern hemisphere (Gray et al., 2009). It is also expected that warmer and drier summers could also affect the seasonal patterns in tick\\nCunze et al. (2021), PeerJ, DOI 10.7717/peerj.12422 13/20\\n\\nactivity and hence the seasonal patterns in the occurrence of the associated diseases (Gray et al., 2009).\\nThere is a high variation between years, in which the tick-borne diseases occur more frequently and years with comparatively low numbers of reported cases. It is of great interest to understand the underlying factors driving this \\ufb02uctuation and to be able to estimate in advance whether high numbers of cases are to be expected in the current year.\\nThere is no doubt that climatic and weather conditions impact tick activity and thus the temporal patterns of tick-borne diseases (Moore et al., 2014). Ticks are known to be very sensitive to temperature and humidity, their requirements and sensitivities differ between the stages of the life cycle which leads to temperature and humidity conditions in\\ufb02uencing tick population dynamics, demographic processes and phenology regarding activity and questing behaviour (Moore et al., 2014). Development rates of ticks are favoured by warmer temperature. Cold winter temperatures and persistent drought in summer are considered to be stress factors for ticks and can lead to reduced abundances in years following a cold winter and to reduced activity during dry summers (Gray et al., 2009). In this context, Bennet, Halling & Berglund (2006) reported an increased incidence of LB cases after mild winters and during humid and warm summers in southern Sweden. For Germany, we did not \\ufb01nd evidence for a clear correlation between the number of human TBD cases and climatic or weather conditions, which is probably due to the complexity of all underlying associations and factors. Besides the obvious impact of weather and climatic conditions, there are important non-entomologic factors impacting the occurrence of tick-borne disease in humans. So, human behaviour, which may favour the contact rates between questing ticks and humans, is regarded as a key factor. Here, climatic or weather factors can also play an indirect role, as favourable weather conditions promote outdoor activities such as mushroom picking (Daniel et al., 2008). Outdoor activities also depend on spatial factors such as forested area or attractive, touristically developed areas.\\nWe found a clear pattern that LB tends to be diagnosed more often in women than in men (Fig. 7A). TBE, on the other hand, is more common in men than in women (Fig. 7B). Similar patterns can be found in other countries (e.g., Z\\u00f6ldi et al. (2013) in Hungary and Sun et al. (2017) for TBE in China) but also different patterns (e.g., Bacon, Kugeler & Mead (2008) for the United States).\\nIn the case of TBE, the vaccination coverage has an important impact. Vaccination is recommended for people in risk areas and for people who are exposed to an increased risk due to their activities (e.g., forest workers). Vaccination coverage varies strongly between regions (Robert Koch-Institut, 2020) and ranged in TBE risk areas in the German Federal States Bavaria, Baden Wurttemberg, Hesse and Thuringia from 20\\u201341% for children at school entry (Hellenbrand et al., 2019). It is assumed that the proportion of vaccinated children is higher than the proportion of vaccinated adults (>15 years Robert Koch-Institut, 2020) but data are currently only available for children at school entry (Hellenbrand et al., 2019).\\nThe signi\\ufb01cant slightly positive trend in TBE case numbers found by Hellenbrand et al. (2019) for the period 2001 to 2018 could not be con\\ufb01rmed in our study for the period\\nCunze et al. (2021), PeerJ, DOI 10.7717/peerj.12422 14/20\\n\\n2002 to 2019, which could be due to the slight decrease in case numbers for 2019. However, to derive reliable evidence for the promotion of tick-borne diseases in Germany due to climate change, longer time series would be required, as well as a standardised reporting and surveillance system. Regarding the number of reported LB cases, a slightly positive trend can be seen. However, this can be attributed in particular to the increase in the period 2002 to 2006, a period in which the reported numbers are subject to additional uncertainties typical of the initial phase of reporting practice. In general, it can be assumed that the number of reported LB cases signi\\ufb01cantly underestimates the actual number of cases (Robert Koch-Institut, 2007; Palmieri et al., 2013). After an initial phase of a surveillance program, the awareness of the population and the diagnostic experience of the medical staff increases over time (Robert Koch-Institut, 2007).\\nWith regard to the spatial but also to the temporal patterns of tick-borne diseases, distribution patterns of host species are of major importance. The most important reservoirs are mice and birds. Voles seem to play an important role as reservoir hosts for TBE, as the virus appears to be well adapted to voles (Z\\u00f6ldi et al., 2015). In addition, other animals such as reptiles, hedgehogs, foxes or rabbits are also regarded as host animals and pathogen reservoirs. In this context, the fructi\\ufb01cation of forest trees can be considered as a potential driver for temporal \\ufb02uctuations in the abundance of hosts, ticks and consequently the incidences of TBE and LB. A high amount of fruit means a good nutritional basis and thus higher abundance for host species such as roe deer, red deer, wild boar and mice. Ostfeld, Jones & Wolff (1996) reported an increase in nymph abundance of Ixodes scapularis 2 years after heavy fructi\\ufb01cation in North America. Distributional patterns of larger host species like dears are also affected by alternating grazing supply, hunting pressure and, in Germany increasingly, by wolf occurrence. Tick abundance has been positively associated with deer abundance (Gilbert, 2010b). We exemplarily displayed occurrence records of three small tick hosts (Myodes glareolus, Apodemus \\ufb02avicollis and shrews of the Soricidae family, Fig. S2), larger tick hosts (Capreolus capreolus, Cervus elaphus and Vulpes vulpes, Fig. S3) and migratory birds (Grus grus, Ciconia ciconia and Turdus merula, Fig. S4). A pattern of these species\\u2019 distributions that explains the spatial patterns in tick-associated diseases does not seem obvious. The distribution pattern of the mammals may be similar to the distribution of the forest areas (Fig. 4H). However, all the maps with observed occurrences provided by GBIF of the here considered species slightly show a coincident pattern with a clustering of points e.g., along the Rhine river (south-western Germany). This could also indicate a certain sampling bias, that in these areas the number of reports is generally higher.\\nRegarding spatial dispersal patterns, birds and particularly migratory birds may be of particular importance. Migratory birds have been found to carry not only ticks but also TBD infected ticks (Hasle et al., 2009; Hasle, 2013). They thus not only serve as hosts for ticks and reservoir hosts for TBD pathogens (Wilhelmsson et al., 2020) but can also play an important role as potential long-distance dispersal vectors for ticks and pathogens. Attached to birds, ticks and associated pathogens can cover large distances, cross geographic barriers (e.g., rivers, oceans and mountains), and possibly be introduced into new areas (Hasle, 2013). Detailed data on resting places of migratory birds in Germany are\\nCunze et al. (2021), PeerJ, DOI 10.7717/peerj.12422 15/20\\n\\npoorly available. However, for example the regions rich in lakes in eastern Germany are considered as breeding places for e.g., cranes. No increased incidence of TBD cases could be detected in these areas, nor could clear correlations between TBD distribution and the distribution patterns of selected bird species (Figs. S2\\u2013S4) be identi\\ufb01ed. In Germany, the blackbirds (Turdus merula) are considered to be one of the most important species for harbouring ticks (Klaus et al., 2016). This species is very common and widespread in Germany.\\nTo conclude, the interactions and interrelationships are complex. For further investigation of the underlying driving factors and their interrelationships to achieve better risk assessment, longer time series and standardized reporting and monitoring programs would be valuable.\\nADDITIONAL INFORMATION AND DECLARATIONS\\nFunding The authors received no funding for this work.\\nCompeting Interests The authors declare that they have no competing interests.\\nAuthor Contributions \\u0003 Sarah Cunze conceived and designed the experiments, analyzed the data, prepared\\n\\ufb01gures and/or tables, authored or reviewed drafts of the paper, and approved the \\ufb01nal draft. \\u0003 Gustav Glock analyzed the data, prepared \\ufb01gures and/or tables, authored or reviewed\\ndrafts of the paper, and approved the \\ufb01nal draft. \\u0003 Sven Klimpel conceived and designed the experiments, authored or reviewed drafts of\\nData Availability The following information was supplied regarding data availability:\\nAll data used in this study is freely available: \\u2022 Data on temperature and precipitation conditions were obtained from the Climate Data Center (CDC) of Deutscher Wetterdienst (DWD) (https://opendata.dwd.de), under the terms of the GeoNutzV 2013 license: https://www.dwd.de/EN/service/copyright/ copyright_node.html.\\n\\u2022 NUTS https://gdz.bkg.bund.de/index.php/default/nuts-gebiete-1-250-000-stand-31- 12-nuts250-31-12.html.\\n\\u2022 CORINE land cover: https://gdz.bkg.bund.de/index.php/default/corine-land-cover-5- ha-stand-2012-clc5-2012.html.\\nBoth are licensed under by the Data licence Germany\\u2013attribution\\u2013version 2.0, http://www.govdata.de/dl-de/by-2-0.\\n\\u2022 GBIF occurrence data: Apodemus \\ufb02avicollis: https://doi.org/10.15468/dl.p4r693 (01 June 2021),\\nCunze et al.

However, many populations have undergone striking declines as their habitats have been lost or degraded by human activities. Terrestrial grasslands are vital habitat for birds in the North American Prairie Pothole Region (PPR), but grassland conversion and fragmentation from agriculture and energy-production activities have destroyed or degraded millions of hectares. Conservation grasslands can provide alternate habitat. In the United States, the Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) is the largest program maintaining con- servation grasslands on agricultural lands, but conservation grasslands in the PPR have declined by over 1 million ha since the program\\u2019s zenith in 2007. We used an ecosystem- services model (InVEST) parameterized for the PPR to quantify grassland-bird habitat remaining in 2014 and to assess the degradation status of the remaining grassland-bird hab- itat as influenced by crop and energy (i.e., oil, natural gas, and wind) production. We com- pared our resultant habitat-quality ratings to grassland-bird abundance data from the North American Breeding Bird Survey to confirm that ratings were related to grassland-bird abun- dance. Of the grassland-bird habitat remaining in 2014, about 19% was degraded by crop production that occurred within 0.1 km of grassland habitats, whereas energy production degraded an additional 16%. We further quantified the changes in availability of grassland- bird habitat under various land-cover scenarios representing incremental losses (10%, 25%, 50%, 75%, and 100%) of CRP grasslands from 2014 levels. Our model identified 1 mil- lion ha (9%) of remaining grassland-bird habitat in the PPR that would be lost or degraded if all CRP conservation grasslands were returned to crop production. Grassland regions world-wide face similar challenges in maintaining avian habitat in the face of increasing com- modity and energy production to sate the food and energy needs of a growing world popula- tion. Identifying ways to model the impacts of the tradeoff between food and energy production and wildlife production is an important step in creating solutions.\\nFunding: Financial support for this effort came from the USDA\\u2019s Natural Resources Conservation Service through their Conservation Effects Assessment Project (CEAP\\u2014Wetlands) and the Farm Service Agency\\u2019s Economics and Policy Analysis Staff.

Thus, the preservation of avian biodiversity has numerous positive benefits to society. Birds are important culturally in arts and literature; recreationally to birdwatchers and hunters; and economically as pollinators, pest predators, seed dispersers, and nutrient cyclers [2]. However, for over two decades, ornithologists have been raising the alarm about the precipitous decline of grassland birds, driven primarily by the loss and degradation of habitat by anthropogenic means [3, 4]. Despite acknowledgment of the issue, grassland-bird habitat continues to be lost and degraded [5\\u20137], and avian popula- tions continue to decline [8]. The Prairie Pothole Region (PPR) of North America is home to 38 of the 41 species classi- fied by Sauer et al. [8] as grassland birds. However, most of the grasslands that these species rely upon for habitat have been converted to alternate uses [5]. Two primary causes of contem- porary habitat loss are crop production and energy development that result in grassland con- version and fragmentation [6, 9, 10]. Neither of these drivers, (i.e., crop production or energy development), are waning. Lark et al. [6] estimated that total net cropland area increased nationwide by 2.98 million acres from 2008 to 2012, with the greatest increases occurring in the PPR. The largest regional crude-oil-production growth through 2025 in the United States is expected to come from the Bakken formation in North Dakota, USA [11]. The International Energy Agency [12] forecasts that the largest growth in world power-generating capacity will be from renewable energies, with the United States the second-biggest market after China. Regionally, the states of North Dakota and South Dakota have abundant wind resources, rou- tinely ranking in the top 20 wind-producing states [13, 14]. A primary cause of habitat degradation is the fragmentation of remaining expanses of grass- land habitat. Habitat fragmentation refers to the reduction in area of some original habitat, a change in spatial configuration (that is, spatial arrangement), and an increasing distance between the patches of what remains, through the subdivision of continuous habitat into smaller pieces [15, 16]. Fragmentation, while increasing overall heterogeneity within a land- scape, can decrease the heterogeneity of individual habitat types within blocks of remaining grasslands. With the loss of heterogeneity within grasslands comes an associated loss of biodi- versity. Fragmentation also lowers habitat quality because of edge effects, such as lower avian reproductive success near the edge than the interior of remaining habitat [17]. The indirect effects on habitat quality can be much larger than the direct effects of habitat loss. For example, McDonald et al. [18] found that 5% of habitat impacts to grassland birds were due to the direct effects of land-clearing activities associated with natural gas and petroleum development, but 95% were the result of habitat fragmentation and species-avoidance behavior. For wind tur- bines, they found similar direct and indirect impacts, 3\\u20135% direct and 95\\u201397% indirect. Thus, any evaluation of grassland-bird habitats should include an assessment of the indirect effects on the quality of remaining habitats. To offset the loss and degradation of native habitats, and the services they provide, both governmental and nongovernmental organizations have made significant monetary invest- ments to restore and protect grassland habitats in the PPR. Given the prominence of agricul- ture throughout the PPR, the most wide-reaching conservation efforts have been associated with various programs of the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA). Within the USDA, the Conservation Reserve Program (CRP) has had the largest impact in terms of establishing perennial grasslands on areas previously used for crop production (S1 Table) [19]. These con- servation grasslands provide numerous ecosystem services, including climate regulation, water purification, and erosion regulation [20]. Habitat created by the conservation grasslands is\\nPLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0198382 January 9, 2019 2 / 17\\n\\nModeling grassland-bird habitat\\nimportant in maintaining populations of wildlife, including grassland-bird species [21\\u201324]. These conservation grasslands can also buffer other adjacent grasslands from the indirect effects of crop production and energy development activities. However, payments to agricul- tural producers participating in the CRP and other conservation programs have often failed to keep pace with rising values of agricultural commodities and land-rental rates [25]. The dispar- ity of profits between participation in a conservation program versus production of agricul- tural commodities or the rental of land for crop production has resulted in a recent exodus of agricultural producers from conservation programs [6, 20, 26]. Since peak enrollment of 14.9 million ha in 2007, CRP grasslands have declined 25% nationally [20]. CRP grasslands in the four states comprising the PPR declined from more than 3.5 million ha in 2007 to just over 2.3 million ha in 2012, a 35% decline [27]. Additionally, new varieties of pesticide-tolerant and drought-resistant crops, as well as the rising popularity of corn (Zea mays) and soy (Glycine max) as biofuels, have resulted in the production of row crops in many areas previously domi- nated by small-grain production and conservation grasslands [27]. In addition to the current loss of conservation grasslands to crop production, increasing demand for domestic energy sources will likely have a negative impact on grassland quantity and quality. McDonald et al. [18] estimated that 20.6 million ha of new land will be required to meet U.S. energy demands by 2030, with temperate grasslands projected to be one of the most highly impacted terrestrial habitat types. The most intact grassland landscapes in the PPR are generally located on high-elevation geological features that are too rugged for mechanized agricultural equipment or too dry for row-crop agriculture, but even these grasslands are threatened due to their potential as sites for wind facilities or for oil and gas development [9, 10]. To increase our understanding of how crop production and energy development has affected the integrity of avian habitat, we quantified suitable grassland-bird habitat across the three Level III ecoregions (Northern Glaciated Plains, Northwestern Glaciated Plains, and Lake Agassiz Plain) [28] and one level IV ecoregion (Des Moines Lobe) [28] that constitute the United States portion of the PPR (Fig 1). We did not attempt to quantify the impact of historic habitat losses in the PPR on grassland birds. Instead, we focused on the contemporary impacts that crop production and energy development activities have on remaining habitats and the role of conservation grasslands in mitigating these impacts. Our specific research objectives were to: 1) quantify the current (2014) grassland-bird habitat within the PPR using a modeling approach that incorporates indirect impacts to habitat integrity, 2) verify that the resultant habitat-quality rankings are related to grassland-bird abundance, 3) quantify the contribution of oil, natural gas, and wind development to the degradation of the remaining grassland habi- tat, and 4) quantify the habitat degradation that would occur if various percentages of CRP conservation grasslands in the PPR were returned to row-crop production. Recognizing that crop production and energy development will likely continue to cause loss and degradation of the remaining grassland-bird habitats, and that CRP grasslands continue to decline across the PPR, we provide a baseline scenario against which future habitat projections can be compared.\\nMaterial and methods\\nStudy area\\nThe PPR covers approximately 82 million ha of the United States and Canada (Fig 1). Glacial processes shaped the region and created a landscape consisting of millions of palustrine wet- lands (often termed prairie potholes) interspersed within a grassland matrix [29, 30]. The PPR is recognized as one of the largest grassland/wetland complexes in the world [31]. It is a glob- ally important ecosystem for a wide variety of flora and fauna including grassland and wetland\\nPLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0198382 January 9, 2019 3 / 17\\n\\nModeling grassland-bird habitat\\nFig 1.

Ecoregions are the Northern Glaciated Plains (NGP), Northwestern Glaciated Plains (NWGP), Lake Agassiz Plain (LAP), and Des Moines Lobe (DML) ecoregions [28].\\nhttps://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0198382.g001\\nplants [32], grassland birds [33], shorebirds [34], waterbirds [35], waterfowl [36], small mam- mals [37], amphibians [38], and aquatic and terrestrial invertebrates, including pollinators [30, 39, 40]. Despite the biological value of the PPR, grassland loss continues, and conservation efforts are not keeping pace [5, 6, 40, 41]. In addition to supporting grassland- and wetland-dependent biota, the combination of the region\\u2019s rich glacial soils and temperate climate has made it an ideal area for agricultural com- modity production [42]. To facilitate crop production, approximately 95% of the native tall- grass prairie and 60% of native mixed-grass prairie have been converted to croplands since European settlement (Fig 1) [43]. In an effort to increase our understanding of how this land- cover change has affected the integrity of avian habitat, we quantified suitable grassland-bird habitat across the three Level III ecoregions (Northern Glaciated Plains, Northwestern Glaci- ated Plains, and Lake Agassiz Plain) [28] and one level IV ecoregion (Des Moines Lobe) [28] that constitute the United States portion of the PPR (Fig 1).\\nModeling approach\\nWe used the Habitat Quality Module of the Integrated Valuation of Ecosystem Services and Tradeoffs (InVEST) modeling suite version 3.2.0 [44] to quantify grassland-bird habitat. InVEST is a suite of spatially based modeling tools that quantify services derived from ecosys- tems, including the maintenance of wildlife habitats [45]. Using InVEST, we modeled grass- land-bird habitat for the year 2014. We chose 2014 because it is the most current year for which we could obtain both energy-development and CRP data layers. We created land-cover\\nPLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0198382 January 9, 2019 4 / 17\\n\\nModeling grassland-bird habitat\\ndata layers by combining the 2014 National Agricultural Statistics Service (NASS) cropland data layer (raster, 30 m2) and a shape file obtained from USDA Farm Service Agency\\u2019s Eco- nomics and Policy Analysis Staff that identified areas enrolled in the CRP in 2014. A complete description of our development of the land-cover layers used in InVEST runs is provided online in S2 Table. To develop a baseline habitat layer, we assigned habitat suitability weights from 0\\u20131 to each land-cover pixel in the cropland data layer (overall accuracy > 83%). Weights were assigned relative to one another, with higher weights representing the most suitable habitat. Suitable grassland-bird habitat was defined as any land-cover category of grassland (i.e., herbaceous grassland [e.g., native prairie], CRP grassland, hayland) and specific categories of small-grain cropland (S3 Table). For example, native prairie and CRP grassland were equally highly weighted (i.e., 1.0), small-grain cropland received a weight half that of grasslands (i.e., 0.5), fal- low land received the lowest weight for habitats (i.e., 0.3), and non-habitat land-cover classes received a weight of 0. For our analysis, suitable grassland-bird habitat was defined as any pixel with a habitat rating \\u0015 0.3, (i.e., the lowest weight assigned to a land-cover class identified as habitat). InVEST takes habitat models one step beyond relative habitat-suitability rankings by incorporating threats to habitat integrity, weighting those threats relative to one another, incorporating the linear distance that those threats influence adjacent habitats, and ranking the sensitivity of habitats to each threat. We identified threats to grassland-bird habitat as the primary causes of fragmentation and degradation of large tracts of grasslands. The primary habitat threats identified were: 1) woodland, 2) urbanization, 3) cropland, 4) roads, and 5) energy development [5, 46\\u201354]. We weighted each threat from 0\\u20131 by expected impact to grassland-bird habitat, with higher weights representing greater habitat degradation (S4 Table). We determined the distance that threats acted upon nearby habitats based on pub- lished literature [9, 10, 47, 48, 50, 51, 55, 56]. We used InVEST to apply these threats to our baseline habitat raster to account for their degradation of nearby habitat. We assigned the greatest threat value to woodland and urbanized areas because grassland birds find these land-cover types virtually unsuitable for all aspects of their life cycle and they harbor predators and nest parasites that affect quality of nearby habitats [17]. Cropland can serve as habitat, (e.g., grains and berries serve as food sources and vegetation serves as escape and shade cover), but disturbance associated with weed control, tillage and harvest usually pre- cludes successful nesting, if nesting is even attempted [57]. Roads, well pads and turbine pads accompanying energy development generally have a small relative footprint on a landscape level, and species show varying degrees of tolerance to these types of disturbances [9,10]. At a pixel level in the InVEST model, a pixel\\u2019s original habitat-ranking value can decrease because of its proximity to a threat, causing one of two outcomes: a decrease in value such that the pixel no longer maintains a value \\u0015 0.3, (i.e., is lost as suitable habitat), or a decrease in value but not below 0.3, (i.e., a degradation in quality but still available as suitable habitat). Thus, loss of habitat can occur under two situations: 1) when a pixel becomes converted from a habitat land-use category to a non-habitat category, as in the situation whereby native prairie gets converted to corn, or 2) when a pixel itself does not change land-use category, but a change in a nearby pixel triggers the threat distance to decrease the focal pixel\\u2019s value below 0.3. Subsequently, we chose to isolate and examine the impact of two of our five threats, crop- land and energy development, because cropland has the greatest footprint in the PPR (Fig 1A) and is the traditional and ongoing major cause of habitat loss for grassland birds, whereas energy development is a more recent, but still developing, threat, and its impact is more localized. We created binary rasters of each threat\\u2019s location across the PPR. We developed cropland and woodland threat layers through a reclassification process of land-cover layers using R\\nPLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0198382 January 9, 2019 5 / 17\\n\\nModeling grassland-bird habitat\\n(version 3.2.0, packages rgdal, raster, sp, and rgeos) [58]. We developed urban and road threat layers using a combination of 2015 Tiger/Line city census data and NASS and developed the energy threat layer by downloading 2014 locations publicly available through the U.S. Geologi- cal Survey (S2 Table). We buffered the turbine locations by 30 m [59] and the gas and oil well locations by 100 m [9] to represent surface impact. When threat locations were applied to the landscape in the model, every threat\\u2019s weight decayed linearly over the maximum distance of its impact, representing greater impact at closer proximity to the threat. To verify that habitat-quality scores are positively associated to grassland-bird abundance, we related the habitat-quality scores output by the model to breeding-bird abundance data using negative binomial regression due to the over-dispersed nature of the count data [60]. We validated the use of InVEST to calculate our habitat covariate by comparing the performance of the InVEST habitat model (InVEST) to an intercept-only model (Null) and a baseline habi- tat rank model (Baseline). We based our bird-abundance estimates on ten avian species that represent mixed-grass prairie endemics and that are considered grassland birds as categorized by Sauer et al. [8]: upland sandpiper (Bartramia longicauda), Sprague\\u2019s pipit (Anthus spra- gueii), chestnut-collared longspur (Calcarius ornatus), clay-colored sparrow (Spizella pallida), savannah sparrow (Passerculus sandwichensis), vesper sparrow (Pooecetes gramineus), grass- hopper sparrow (Ammodramus savannarum), Baird\\u2019s sparrow (Ammodramus bairdii), bobo- link (Dolichonyx oryzivorus), and western meadowlark (Sturnella neglecta). We acquired count data for these species from the North American Breeding Bird Survey (BBS), a continental, road-side survey conducted annually since 1966 [8, 61]. We pooled the sum of the counts of all ten species from 2013\\u20132015 (N = 2100) by BBS stop for North Dakota, the state for which spa- tial coordinates by stop were available [62]. We included the years on either side of 2014 to capture the full temporal shift in bird response to disturbance caused by initial development of threats as well as potential temporal lags in grassland-bird responses to threat establishment, respectively. We buffered each survey stop by 400 m, the distance at which birds are assumed to be detected in the surveys and calculated the mean habitat quality within this buffer from our InVEST output and compared these values to the grassland-bird abundance estimate for that point. We next used InVEST to quantify current (2014) grassland-bird habitat quality and quan- tity, and grassland-bird habitat quality and quantity among our various scenarios of CRP loss for the PPR within the United States. For our CRP grassland loss scenarios, we created polygon sets containing 100%, 75%, 50%, 25%, 10% and 0% of the CRP fields in our 2014 baseline land-cover layer using a random, successive subsetting method so that CRP fields included in lower percentage sets were also included in the higher percentage sets. Using each set of poly- gons as a mask, these fields were converted to row crops in our baseline land-use layer to simu- late the conversion of CRP grassland habitat to agriculture. By removing percentages of fields rather than total area in our baseline data layer, we followed the assumption that if an agricul- tural producer decided to remove land from a conservation program, this decision would be made on a field-by-field basis rather than on an unrealistic pixel-by-pixel basis. We compared land-cover layers for each percentage-loss scenario to total CRP grassland area in the 0% loss layer to verify that the correct percentage of CRP grassland was converted to cropland. We used an output cell size of 30 m. A half-saturation constant of 0.20 was selected by comparing multiple runs of the InVEST model and was used to optimize visual display of the resulting layer [63]. In each run (i.e., scenario), the model worked to erode the quality value of identified grassland-bird habitats (initial value \\u00150.3) based on spatial proximity to a threat, susceptibility to that threat, and the threat\\u2019s strength (i.e., threat weight). Output data layers from the model were used to create maps depicting changes in grassland-bird habitat quality among scenarios\\nPLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0198382 January 9, 2019 6 / 17\\n\\nModeling grassland-bird habitat\\nTable 1.

From our habitat quality maps, we produced summary tables quantifying changes in suitable-habitat quantity (ha) by ecoregions.\\nResults\\nCompared to the intercept-only model and the baseline model, the InVEST habitat model bet- ter accounted for increases in breeding-bird abundance (\\u0394AIC > 2; Table 1). We verified that resultant InVEST habitat-quality ratings were positively related to abundance of grassland birds in North Dakota (coefficient = 1.76, \\u00b197.5% C.I. = 0.15, Fig 2). The relationship between abundance estimates from BBS surveys and our modeled bird abundance was significantly dif- ferent from zero (C.I. range: 1.61\\u20131.92). We calculated a pseudo R-squared of 0.29 (\\u00b197.5% C. I. = 0.03), indicating fair model fit but suggesting that unmeasured covariates in addition to habitat quality influenced actual bird occurrence. Also, of note, BBS stops with a habitat score < 0.3 had an average abundance of 5, and those with scores \\u0015 0.30 had an average abun- dance of 15. Thus, while points with high habitat-quality ratings were associated with both low and high bird abundance, points with low quality ratings were almost always associated with low bird abundance (Fig 2). From our baseline (2014) model and our definition of suitable habitat as any land-cover type with a habitat-quality ranking higher than 0.3, we estimated that around 12 million ha of suitable grassland-bird habitat (i.e., habitat quality score \\u00150.3) remained within the four PPR ecoregions in 2014 (Table 2; Fig 1B). The Northern Glaciated Plains and Northwestern Glaci- ated Plains ecoregions accounted for over 80% of the suitable grassland-bird habitat. Availabil- ity of suitable grassland-bird habitat was lowest in the Des Moines Lobe ecoregion. The area of cropland (8.9 million ha) greatly exceeded the area devoted to energy development (44.5 thou- sand ha, Table 2). Our application of the InVEST model to quantify effects of cropland and energy develop- ment demonstrated low impact (65,800 ha) in causing original habitat-quality rankings to become unsuitable, (i.e., falling below 0.3) due to the influence of nearby cropland or energy development threats (Table 3). However, cropland and energy development had a much greater impact in terms of degrading the quality of habitat when habitats that did not drop below a score of 0.3 are included. In this case, cropland degraded 19% (2.1 million ha) of the available grass-land bird habitat, whereas energy development degraded 16% (1.9 million ha, Table 3). Among ecoregions, remaining grassland-bird habitats in the Northern Glaciated Plains and the Des Moines Lobe were degraded the most by cropland and the Northwestern Glaciated Plains the least, whereas the Northern Glaciated Plains and the Northwestern Glaci- ated Plains were degraded the most and the Des Moines Lobe the least by energy development. Although not nearly as ubiquitous in distribution as cropland, where energy development occurs, its localized impact can be significant (S1 Fig). Land within the PPR is surveyed according to the Public Land Survey System of dividing land into parcels, one division of which is a township comprised of thirty-six 1-mi2 (259 ha) sections [64]. We found entire townships were rendered unsuitable habitat by the clustering of oil wells in close proximity\\nPLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0198382 January 9, 2019 7 / 17\\n\\nModeling grassland-bird habitat\\nFig 2.

Our scenario quantifying the impact of cropland on the suitability of current (2014) CRP conservation grassland as grassland-bird habitat showed suitable habitat loss of less than 1%, although it caused degradation of 13% of the grassland-bird habitat (Table 3). The largest decline in habitat quality occurred in the Northern Glaciated Plains and the least in the Des Moines Lobe. Our scenario-based CRP modeling revealed a loss in suitable grassland-bird habitat (-2% across the PPR) if 25% of CRP grasslands present in 2014 are returned to agricultural produc- tion. This loss of suitable habitat increases to 9% (a loss of approximately 1 million ha) if all\\nPLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0198382 January 9, 2019 8 / 17\\n\\nModeling grassland-bird habitat\\nTable 2.

An important distinction between InVEST and other approaches is that InVEST allows for not only the modeling of land-cover conversion scenarios, but also the quantification of how habitat \\u201cthreats\\u201d impact landscape-level habitat availability to an organism. This allows for more robust quantifications of how matrices of land cover, some of which are suitable habitat for birds and some of which are habitat threats, interact to affect overall landscape integrity, in our case for grassland birds. We did not attempt to forecast grassland-bird population sizes, but rather quantified habitat quality as influenced by threats and susceptibility to those threats. Multiple factors in addition to summertime nesting habitat affect grassland-bird populations; some (e.g., condition of win- tering habitat) are far removed from our study region. Thus, prediction of population sizes was beyond the scope of our work. However, habitat-quality information derived from the methodology described here could play an important role in the development and improve- ment of grassland-bird population models. We also did not attempt to quantify a monetary aspect to the losses in grassland-bird habitat. While the estimation of monetary gains or losses associated with loss or degradation of habitats and effects on ecosystem services is useful in guiding decisions, such quantifications were well beyond the scope of our research effort. Rather, we focused on the preliminary step necessary to calculate the monetary effects of losses and degradation, that being the quantification of habitat losses and degradation itself. We\\nPLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0198382 January 9, 2019 10 / 17\\n\\nModeling grassland-bird habitat\\nprovide methodology to obtain such quantifications. Additionally, in most cases, monetary gains or losses resulting from losses and degradation of habitat need to be calculated on a case- by-case basis as each \\u201cproject\\u201d has its own, often very different, inputs in terms of costs (e.g., converting land, installing wind turbines, constructing roads, loss of birding opportunities, degradation of other ecosystem services) and benefits (e.g., food production, energy produc- tion, restoration of bird populations). To illustrate our method, we chose to quantify the degree to which one traditional and widespread threat, cropland, and one nascent but more localized threat, energy development, influenced the availability of suitable grassland-bird habitat in the current (2014) matrix of land cover in the PPR. We further illustrate the differences that these two threats have to a spe- cific area. It is key to note that, with the exception of our CRP-conversion scenarios, we did not quantify the direct loss of habitat resulting from conversion of grasslands to cropland or due to energy development. Rather, we quantified the effects of habitat threats within the cur- rent (2014) landscape configuration on the remaining area of suitable grassland-bird habitat within that landscape. Because of cropland\\u2019s pervasiveness throughout the PPR, its cumulative impact as a threat to remaining grassland-bird habitat is great, degrading remaining grassland- bird habitat at rates varying from 13\\u201331% across the region (Table 3). Energy development, as a much more localized threat, had a smaller impact at 4\\u201319% degradation rates across the region. However, in places where energy development has occurred, the localized impact has affected entire blocks of 36 mi2 (93.2 km2) townships (S1 Fig). By examining these threats at the ecoregion level, we were able to determine those ecoregions in which grassland-bird habi- tats have been the most impacted by either cropland or energy development. Cropland and energy development threats caused <1% of remaining grassland-bird habitat to fall from \\u201csuitable\\u201d to \\u201cunsuitable\\u201d as habitat. This may be explained in terms of where crop- land and energy development occur, which is in rural areas where, when a land-cover change occurs (i.e., a crop/non-crop interface), that other edge is most likely to be grassland, which will have a fairly high relative suitability ranking. The impact to watch, therefore, is the degree to which remaining suitable habitat is degraded due to its proximity to cropland and energy development. It is in this category that we see the influence of cropland and energy take a marked toll on the integrity of grassland-bird habitat. It is also important to note that not all cropland areas are unsuitable as grassland-bird habitat. Grassland-like crops and small-grains, such as alfalfa and wheat, have some value as avian habitat, whereas row crops such as corn and soybeans do not (S3 Table). Therefore, we would expect highest degradation in highly fragmented areas, (e.g., where grassland and cropland edges regularly abut, and where those cropland edges are row crops). The highest degradation, 31%, occurred in the Des Moines Lobe, which includes the extensive corn and soy fields of Iowa. A final point is that the low amount of habitat that fell below 0.3 indicates that the greatest threat to grassland integrity is not degradation, but the more direct effects of conversion to row crops, in which pixels that rank as high as 1 immediately fall below 0.3 upon conversion. As to energy development, the largest congregation of oil and gas wells in the PPR is in the Bakken Region of northwestern North Dakota, and it is in the Northern Glaciated Plains that energy development has caused the greatest degradation in remaining grassland-bird-habitat quality. The threat of cropland to CRP habitat quality is fairly uniform across all ecoregions except the Des Moines Lobe, which has minimal degradation, which would occur if very little CRP occurred in that ecoregion. In ecoregions in which CRP is a large component of the grass- land landscape, its adjacency to cropland threatens its integrity. In these areas, maintaining primarily grassland landscapes, either of CRP or native prairie, will be important for the main- tenance of grassland-bird-habitat quality.\\nPLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0198382 January 9, 2019 11 / 17\\n\\nModeling grassland-bird habitat\\nOur application of InVEST\\u2019s Habitat Quality Module to the CRP-conversion scenario revealed that if all-remaining CRP lands are returned to crop production, losses of suitable grassland-bird habitat would equal approximately 9% of the total suitable habitat available across the PPR in 2014. The CRP is a long-acknowledged driver in the maintenance and stabi- lization of grassland-bird populations [65\\u201367]. The effects on grassland birds of losing close to one-tenth of their remaining suitable habitat in the PPR would undoubtedly be significant, and each ecoregion would face unique circumstances. The Des Moines Lobe and Lake Agassiz Plain ecoregions have already lost most of their natural grassland habitat due to intensive agri- cultural development. The Des Moines Lobe, which would lose 36% of its remaining suitable grassland-bird habitat, and the Lake Agassiz Plain, which would lose 19%, can each barely afford to lose additional habitat. Even with CRP intact, several grassland-bird species in these regions are in decline and species of federal conservation concern [68]. The loss of CRP could plausibly facilitate the extirpation of several grassland-bird species and render those regions species depauperate. The Northern and Northwestern Glaciated Plains each have significantly more remaining grassland-bird habitat than the other two ecoregions. However, our model results demonstrate that loss of CRP would affect them at different levels; amount of suitable habitat in the North- ern Glaciated Plains (10% loss of grassland-bird habitat under 100% CRP loss scenario) was more dependent on CRP lands than in the Northwestern Glaciated Plains (3% loss under the same CRP loss scenario). Most of the Northwestern Glaciated Plains is made up of an area known as the Missouri Coteau. The topography of the Missouri Coteau is varied, with greater local relief and rockier, less fertile, soils than in the Northern Glaciated Plains to the east. As a result, croplands, while still the major land cover-type, are less abundant, and native grassland pastures form a larger component of the Northwestern Glaciated Plains landscape than do conservation grasslands. CRP grasslands still provide significant habitat in this ecoregion, but native pastures also contribute to the maintenance of the ecoregion\\u2019s avian biodiversity. Even so, loss of CRP grasslands in the Northwestern Glaciated Plains are compounded by the impact of oil and gas development prevalent in this region and likely have a negative impact on species of conservation concern, such as the Sprague\\u2019s Pipit, Baird\\u2019s Sparrow, and McCown\\u2019s Long- spur (Rhyncophanes mccownii) [67]. The results of our modeling efforts identify recent past and potential future bird habitat losses in the PPR of the United States. However, they also identify opportunities for the improvement of habitats if current trends can be reversed, either through gains in CRP or through other conservation programs that lead to increases in grassland habitats on the PPR landscape (e.g., USDA Natural Resources Conservation Service\\u2019s Agricultural Conservation Easement Program). The potential of conservation grasslands to mitigate grassland-bird habitat loss in the PPR has been demonstrated by the amount of suitable habitat that has been created on the landscape through a single conservation program, the CRP. If the CRP was not as suc- cessful as it has been in providing avian habitat on the PPR landscape, we would not see losses of these lands from the landscape resulting in such significant declines in suitable grassland- bird habitat in our modeled scenarios, and our validation work demonstrated that declines in habitat-quality ratings are related to declines in overall grassland-bird abundances. Thus, the CRP and other conservation programs can play a significant role in restoring grassland-bird populations in the PPR. However, care must be taken to recognize the transitory nature of con- servation lands that are not protected through fee-title ownership or through long-term ease- ments. As seen through recent losses of CRP conservation grasslands across the PPR landscape, lands protected through short-term contracts will likely revert to other uses during periods when conservation payments lag behind profits that can be realized through conversion back to crop production. The CRP is subject to shifting political priorities. In recent years, the CRP\\nPLOS ONE | https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0198382 January 9, 2019 12 / 17\\n\\nModeling grassland-bird habitat\\nenrollment cap as enacted by the U.S. Congress has fallen from the peak of 14.9 million hect- ares in 2007 to 9.7 million hectares in 2018 and may slightly rise to 11 million hectares with the passage of the 2018 Farm Bill. Although the value of the CRP to grassland birds is irrefutable, developing other programs to sustain grassland-bird populations could provide a buffer to the transitory nature of CRP grasslands. Populations of grassland birds would be expected to rise with increasing CRP conservation grasslands but maintaining that population growth when CRP conservation grasslands are converted back to cropland if Farm Bill caps again drop will be a challenge without the existence of grasslands created in other programs. An economic climate driven by demands for commodities has resulted in marked losses of grassland-bird habitat not just in the PPR, but worldwide. The resulting impact on species dependent upon habitat provided by natural and conservation lands could be substantial as these lands are converted to commodity production. Conversely, providing perennial grass- land cover on agricultural lands through conservation programs has great potential to reverse these trends. Our results are applicable beyond the PPR in areas where grassland-bird habitats consist of grasslands embedded in a cropland matrix and economic pressures favor the conver- sion of natural and conservation grasslands to crop production and energy development. The application of scenario-based models such as InVEST to quantify grassland-bird habitats can identify potential regional effects of land-cover change. This knowledge will be needed to facil- itate the improvement and ultimate success of grassland-bird conservation efforts.\\nSupporting information\\nS1 Table.

The latter is capable to activate CO2 to furnish the borane-stabilized bis(silanone) 3 through mono-oxygenation of the dative SiII!B silicon centers under release of CO. Removal of BPh3 from 3 with PMe3 affords the corresponding 1,3,2,4- cyclodisiloxane and the Me3P@BPh3 adduct. All isolated new compounds were characterized and their molecular structures were determined by single-crystal X-ray diffrac- tion analyses.\\nDue to a large polarization of the Si=O bond and the re- markably weak Si@O p bond (58.5 kJmol@1) compared to the Si@O s-bond strength (119.7 kJmol@1), compounds with a Si=O bond are intrinsically susceptible to auto-oligomerization to the corresponding polysiloxanes.[10] Thus, introduction of an electron donor at the Si atom or/and an acceptor at the O atom are needed to disfavor head-to-tail oligomerization of the polar Si=O bond.[11] This led to the first Lewis acid-base supported silanone complex, the silaformamide\\u2013borane A (Scheme 1), which was reported by us in 2007, starting from a silylene and H2O\\u00b7B(C6F5)3.[12] Roesky et al. described in 2011 the isolation of the acid anhydride B generated from the reaction of a chlorosilylene with H2O\\u00b7B(C6F5)3 in the presence of NHC.[13]\\nThe activation of small molecules using non- and semi-metal- based compounds is an attractive field in main-group chemis- try which led to the discovery of new activation modes and types of reactions.[1] In this context, the concept of frustrated Lewis pairs (FLPs) for cooperative activation of inert bonds em- ploying Lewis acids and bases, firstly reported by Stephan, Erker and co-workers, is a landmark discovery.[2] Since then, the rapid expansion of FLP chemistry has paved the way to differ- ent inter- and intramolecular systems in which the majority is based on sterically encumbered phosphorus- and nitrogen- centered Lewis bases and organoboranes as Lewis acids.[3] Al- though divalent carbon species such as N-heterocyclic car- benes (NHCs) have also been successfully probed in FLP chemistry for the activation of CO2, H2 and N2O, the use of analogous Lewis pairs-containing silylenes is less known.[4,5]\\nSimilarly, Roesky et al. reported also the silaformyl chloride complex C, resulting from an NHC-stabilized silylene and H2O\\u00b7B(C6F5)3.[14] In 2019, the isolation of the first donor\\u2013accept- or-supported silaaldehyde D was accomplished by the Inoue group.[15] Remarkably, Kippings dream of isolable genuine sila- nones was realized in 2014 with the isolation of the first metal- losilanone by Filippou[16] and 2017 by the groups of Inoue and Rieger.[17] Very recently, a silicon analogue of a ketone with an unperturbed Si=O bond was synthesized by Iwamoto and co- workers.[18]\\nStarting from an in situ generated silylene\\u2013borane adduct, Teng et al. reported in 2016 on the activation of THF leading to the isolation of a corresponding ring-opening product.[20]\\nThe silicon(II) atom in silylenes exhibits an ambiphilic character due to its vacant 3p orbital (LUMO) and the 3s-centered lone pair (HOMO). Owing to their interesting property and reactivity, stable N-heterocyclic silylenes (NHSis), the heavier analogues of NHCs, have been utilized successfully for the metal-free acti- vation of small molecules[6] and as powerful steering ligands in homogeneous catalysis.[7] After the first isolation of an N-heter-\\n[a] M.-P.

Removal of BPh3 from 3 by addi- tion of PMe3 leads to the corresponding 1,3,2,4-cyclodisiloxane through intramolecular Si=O head-to-tail dimerization.

The identity of 2 was proven by elemental analysis, single-crystal X-ray diffraction analysis and multinu- clear NMR spectroscopy in the solid state and in solution. Crys- tals suitable for an X-ray diffraction analysis were obtained in a concentrated toluene solution of 2 at @308C, the crystals are a mixture of the two rotational conformers (Figure 1; see also the Supporting Information).\\nFigure 1.

Selected bond angles [8]: C2-Si1-B1 130.74(9), C9- Si2-B2 130.63(9).\\nCompound 2 crystallizes in the monoclinic space group P121/c1 in which both silicon centers adopt a distorted tetrahe- dral geometry (8Si1=356.728, 8B1=319.808) with Si@B distan- ces of 2.089(2) and 2.077(2) a, similar to those of related silico- n(II)\\u2013boranes adducts (1.9624(5)\\u20132.108(2) a).[9] Given the low solubility of 2 in deuterated benzene and THF, only a broad 29Si NMR signal of low intensity was observed at d=54.0 ppm which is low-field shifted compared to 1 (d=43.3 ppm). The\\nsolid-state 29Si NMR (VACP/MAS) spectrum of 2 shows a singlet at d=48.6 ppm (1: d=41.6 ppm). The iso- tropic 11B chemical shift was observed in [D8]THF sol- utions at d=@7.8 ppm (Dn1/2=356 Hz) which is, as expected, low-field shifted due to its coordination to the SiII center (BPh3: d(11B)=55.2 ppm, C6D6).[9]\\nCompound 2 is inert towards H2 and CO but reacts with CO2 in C6D6 under ambient conditions (1 bar, 298 K), resulting in the simultaneous formation of a pale-yellow solid and CO as confirmed by an addi- tional 13C-labeling experiment (See the Supporting In- formation, S11). Resolving the solid in [D8]THF and re- cording its multinuclear NMR spectra revealed the formation of a new species with a strongly high-field shifted 29S NMR singlet resonance at d=@44.7 ppm (2: d=+54.1 ppm). An X-ray diffraction analysis of single crystals revealed the formation of the borane- stabilized bis(silanone) 3, was isolated in 94% yields (Figure 2).\\nScheme 2.

This process is re- versible because removal of the solvent and PMe3 in vacuum and re-dissolving of the residue in C6D6 furnishes compound 2 as shown by NMR spectroscopy.\\nThe silicon center in 3 adopts a distorted tetrahedral geome- try with a short Si@O distance of 1.557(4) and 1.537(4) a in ac- cordance with related four-coordinated Lewis acid stabilized si- lanones (1.531\\u20131.579 a) containing a Si=O double bond.[12\\u201315,19,21\\u201322] The Si@O distance is only slightly elongated when compared with recently reported genuine silanones (1.518\\u20131.537 a).[15\\u201318] Bis(silanone) 3 is remarkable stable in so- lution ([D8]THF) and no changes in the 1H NMR spectra were observed upon heating to 608C. Compound 3 represents a rare example of borane-stabilized silanones. Aldridge and co- workers achieved the isolation of a stabilized silaaldehyde through chloride\\u2013hydride substitution using K[HBEt3].[21] Addi- tion of B(C6F5)3 to a cyclic amino(bora-ylide(silanone)) reported by Kato et al., increased the stability of the pre-formed free si- lanone.[22] In the presence of B(C6F5)3, Roesky et al. accom- plished the isolation of a donor\\u2013acceptor stabilized silaformyl chloride.[14] However, isolation of a borane-stabilized silanone starting from a silylene\\u2013borane system is not reported so far.\\nIn contrast to the oxygenation of 2 with CO2, treatment of 2 with elemental sulfur in toluene at room temperature leads to the selective formation of the \\u2018borane-free\\u2019 bis(silathione) 5. Compound 5 is identical with the product from the reaction of bis(silylene) 1 with elemental sulfur in toluene at room temper- ature, which was isolated in 54% yield (Scheme 4). Similar to the product of an intramolecular silylene\\u2013borane FLP with ele- mental sulfur reported by our group,[19] no Si=S!B interaction was observed. The structure of 5 (Figure 4) features two Si=S bonds with a low-field shifted singlet 29Si NMR signal at d= 12.1 ppm. The Si=S distances of 1.9867(13) and 1.9858(13) a are consistent with related silathiones with four-coordinate sili- con atoms [{PhC(NtBu)2}Si(S)Cl] (2.079(6) a) and as reported for a Si=S product from sulfuration of an intramolecular silylene\\u2013 borane FLP with elemental sulfur (1.9795(10) a).[19,26] Bis(sila- thione) 5 is stable in C6D6 solutions over a period of several weeks which can be explained by a less polarized Si=S bond (DEN=0.7) compared to the Si=O bond (DEN=1.7) based on their electronegativities (EN).\\nIn summary, the synthesis of bis(silylene-borane) Lewis adduct 2 containing two SiII\\u2013BPh3 moieties in a single molecule was presented. Exposure of 2 to CO2 yields the corresponding\\nTo remove the boranes from the bis(silanone\\u2013borane) com- plex 3, trimethylphosphane (PMe3, 5 equiv) was added. This re- sulted in the clean formation of the corresponding Lewis pair Me3P!BPh3 (31P NMR: @15.3 ppm) and the 1,3,2,4-cyclodisilox- ane 4 (head-to-tail dimer of Si=O moieties). The latter is identi- cal with the isolated product from the reaction of 1 with CO2 in 76% yields (Scheme 2). Single crystals of 4 suitable for X-ray diffraction analysis were obtained from a concentrated solution in a 1:1 benzene/hexane mixture at room tempera- ture (Figure 3). The formation of Me3P!BPh3 was ad- ditionally confirmed by a single-crystal X-ray analysis obtained in the reaction mixture of 3 and PMe3 in THF solutions (see the Supporting Information).\\nAs expected, the five-coordinate silicon centers in 4 show a drastically high-field shifted 29Si NMR chemi- cal shift at d=@92.1 ppm (3: d=@44.7 ppm).

Removal of the borane with PMe3 yields 1,3,2,4-cy- clodisiloxane 4 through intramolecular Si=O head-to-tail dime- rization. In contrast, the reaction of 2 with elemental sulfur yields exclusively the borane-free bis(silathione) 5 which shows no tendency to undergo dimerization.\\nAcknowledgements\\nsilylene ligands, see: S.
